Mini task history website

MVP fast as possible

its all about making tracks, celebrating long running tracks.

index page should have anon tracks made today, this week, to date etc all about encouragement...

Add week totals as default in a header somehow?

have a popular suggestion for tags, easy to click and open add?

add peek to day/week/month/year streaks, start this:
	1st attempt add just count of each type per time selected.
	2nd add a simple graph
	3rd add wax graph
	4th add polished glitz!

add remove/edit eventually to past entries.

have a business or personel panel choice.





Full accounts & email from day one
sql setup properly eg admin user and master



Use:
scss/sass
sql database
node
vue + vuex
pm2 
webtokens
??
go for full unit testing



future, make a pwa/app. For now just api and barebones website

- use transactions and connection pooling for mysql
- change user params to user query so its properly done!

THIS >>>>
like the idea of the projects being swipable horizontal across the header with new at the side ..
and all tasks falling out from under, super fast project and task switching
.. all controls in a floating header bar nice
